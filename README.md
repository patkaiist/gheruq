# ġħeruq
_Ġħeruq_ /ɛːrʊʔ/ is a simple tool for autmated root detection for Maltese, with checks against the Hans Wehr's _A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic_ for potential cognate root matches if the sqlite3 database file is found locally.

The only intent is to work out roots with some level of reliability. Comparisons to Arabic serve as an additional check of accuracy, as a Maltese root of Semitic origin which does _not_ have a corresponding Arabic root may be either mistakenly identified as semitic, mistakenly parsed for binyan patterns or mimmation, or otherwise erroneous.

This repository does not include a copy of the Hans Wehr database file. You will need to find this elsewhere on GitHub.

I put this program together after searching for something which served this purpose without success. There are still some issues to be solved and improvements to be made, but for most cases it is working as expected now.
