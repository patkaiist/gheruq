# għeruq
_Għeruq_ is a simple program for autmated root detection for Maltese, with checks against the Hans Wehr's _A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic_ for potential root matches.

The only intent is to work out roots with some level of reliability. Comparisons to Arabic serve as an additional check of accuracy, as a Maltese root of Semitic origin which does _not_ have a corresponding Arabic root may be either mistakenly identified as semitic, mistakenly parsed for binyan patterns or mimmation, or otherwise erroneous.

I put this program together after searching for something which served this purpose without success.
